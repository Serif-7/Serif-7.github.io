      <description>You could say that it has never been easier to learn how to program. Python tutorials abound, there is an endless number of free courses, an even more endless number of free books, et cetera, et cetera.
However, when I was first learning to write code, those tutorials did not tell me what I wanted to know. What I wanted to know was how a computer works, and what what does it mean to program it?</description>

      <description>Ah, Morrowind. Widely regarded as one of the best RPGs of all time. It was my first PC game at around four or five years old, though I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever got out of Seyda Neen. It&amp;rsquo;s a great game and an important landmark in gaming history. Personally, I would argue it is Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;purest&amp;rsquo; RPG.
Sadly, it has not aged well. Playing it today, when we&amp;rsquo;re all spoiled with modern conveniences, is kind of like reading a classic novel.</description>
