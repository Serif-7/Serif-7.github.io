      <description>Ah, Morrowind. Widely regarded as one of the best RPGs of all time. It was my first RPG at around four or five years old, though I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever got out of Seyda Neen. It&amp;rsquo;s a great game and an important landmark in gaming history. Personally, I would argue it is Bethesda&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;purest&amp;rsquo; RPG.
Sadly, it has not aged well. Playing it today, when we&amp;rsquo;re all spoiled with modern conveniences, is kind of like reading a classic novel.</description>
