AKA phenomenal consciousness, phenomenology, qualia, subjective character of experience, 'what it is like'

"It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions. And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine." — Gottfried Leibniz, *Monadology*

The purpose of this post is to lay out the Hard Problem of Consciousness, its various details, and what makes it so difficult. I've noticed the occasional discussion online of this problem is woefully under-informed, and also when I try to explain the Hard Problem to my friends they often don't know what the hell I am talking about. Hopefully writing it all out will make it clearer, and if so, I can just send them a link to this post.

**What is Consciousness?**

I experience phenomena. When I look at a ripe apple, I know what it is *like* to look at an object with a red color. When I bite into the apple, I know what it is like to taste its sweetness.

This obviously isn't surprising. When I look at the apple, light bounces off its skin into my eyes, and my brain interprets that light as being red. Similarly for the tongue, the taste and texture of the apple is sent to my brain by my nervous system. A conceptually similar process takes place in order for my brain to interpret the taste as being sweet.

How our senses physically work is something we understand reasonably well at this point. We may not know everything about them, but we can imagine that any further mysteries are ones we are capable of solving. At very least, there is nothing baffling about the senses metaphysically. What is baffling is why *I experienced* those sensations of sight and taste.

A reader unfamiliar with this topic may not know what I mean. Language runs up against itself when attempting to describe the phenomena of conscious experience itself. This is possibly because conscious experience is the only *non-physical* thing that we can say exists, and language was made to describe physical things. We also can't describe consciousness in terms of anything more primitive. It just 'is'.

Perhaps the best definition we have of consciousness is 'the subjective quality of experience.' Thomas Nagel, in his 1974 paper "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", expressed it in the following way:  "...an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism."

Experiences of phenomena are certainly real, but where are they? In the brain itself you will find only neurons, synapses, dendrites, electrochemical reactions, and so on that all contain the physical information *corresponding to* and *co-occuring with* the experience of reality, but you won't find the experience itself. As far as we can tell, conscious experience, despite being the thing we most know is real, does not exist in the physical world.

**What Conscious Experience is Not**

1. I am not referring to the state of being awake or aware. It's possible to be asleep and still have 'conscious experience'. We experience dreams, after all.
2. I am not referring to anything psychological. Psychology, and cognitive science generally, is about explaining human behavior. It studies the mind/brain as a physical object and examines mental states purely for what causes them, and what they themselves cause. While it's likely true that conscious experience has some effect on our psyche, perhaps even a significant one, that isn't the phenomenon we are focusing on.

**Properties of Consciousness**
1. *Linked to a Physical System:* Barring [panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism), conscious experience seems to arise from physical brains.
2. *Non-Observable*: We can't observe conscious experience from the third-person or even empirically verify that it exists. We can scan a brain and perhaps see whatever object the brain is seeing, but we can't access what it was subjectively *like* for the person to observe that object.
3. *Irreducable:* Consciousness, as far as we can tell, cannot be explained in terms of some lesser mechanism. This contrasts with psychological processes like learning, memory, or language, where we can explain it as some pattern of brain activity that is a response to the organism's environment. We can see and inspect all the wheels and gears of the operations in the brain that constitute what those things *are*. We can't do the same for conscious experience. No amount of investigation into neurons and synapses will explain how or why there is 'something that it is like' to be a human being, instead of it being like nothing at all.
4. *Unpredictable:* Even knowing all the facts of physics, biology, information processing, dynamic systems, neurology, and so on, there would still be no reason to then predict that humans would have conscious experience. Despite being linked to the physical world in some way, it doesn't seem to logically follow from any physical law.

**The Great Divide**

Conscious experience, as far as we know, cannot be observed unless you are the person experiencing it. As such, we cannot communally prove that consciousness exists. That fact, plus the difficulty of defining it has led to what Chalmers called 'the Great Divide': Among philosophers, about 30 percent of them do not believe that the Hard Problem exists. When you try to explain the Hard Problem to someone, there is a significant chance that they just won't get it. They will not know what you are really referring to by 'conscious experience' or 'subjective character'.

**Various Statements of the Hard Problem:**
1. Why is there anything that actually experiences the processed inputs of our senses? In other words, why is there a receiver (which might be called the Self) for the signal (which might be called external reality)?
2. How and why does something that appears to be non-physical, that being conscious experience, arise from a physical system?

**The P-Zombie Argument**

The philosophical zombie or 'zombie world' is the primary argument relied on by David Chalmers in his book *The Conscious Mind* (1996). It proceeds as follows:

Imagine a world physically identical to ours, with the same physical laws. In that world are our doppelgangers: exactly the same as you and I are now. The only difference between this hypothetical world and ours is that consciousness does not exist. The humans of this world will think, talk, learn, and react to their environment, because that is what what human brains do. They get angry, happy, sad, but only in the sense that the appropriate processes take place in the brain in response to stimuli. They do not have conscious experience. There is no receiver for the signal of reality. They are machines made of flesh.

The point of this hypothetical is not to consider whether such zombies are naturally possible in our world. They probably aren't. The point is that we can imagine such a world fairly easily. In other words, the zombie world is a logically coherent concept. If physicalism (the belief that reality is entirely physical) is true, then another world with the same physical laws and facts would be completely indistinguishable from ours.[^1] The zombie world is such a world, but it is not indistinguishable, because it lacks consciousness. Therefore physicalism is false.

Because we can conceive of a world without consciousness, it appears to be the case that consciousness is somehow 'added on' to our world. It is what is called a **further fact**. By this I mean that consciousness doesn't logically follow from any physical condition, despite arising from brains. It may be the case that, like gravity, consciousness is a fundamental law of our world, and this leads us to the Hard Problem: Why?
