The year doesn't matter. With the advances of bio-reconstitution technology, Death can now be avoided for the price of 500 dollars. Mass shootings are now a common nuisance in city streets. The rich and powerful live forever and cannot be killed. You are a serf of hyper-capitalism who has just signed up to Uber for hitmen. With a few bullets, some fresh fish, and a CEO mindset, you will be well on your way to becoming a true sigma male.

*Cruelty Squad* is a horrifying scream of despair created by Finnish artist and 3D modeler Ville Kallio. Before making the game, he exhibited his art in several gallery shows and was a cartoonist and illustrator, but considered it a 'black hole with no future'. His work has often featured organized violence from state or security forces, and he's elaborated on this particular kind of violence as being ['the purest crystallization of a type of legalized murderlust.'](https://lvl3official.com/ville-kallio/)

I've played a lot of video games. To be honest with you, most games are more concerned with being fun than having anything to say. And that's fine, I know from personal experience that making games that work is already very difficult without having to add ideas on top of it, and the people making and buying games are usually more concerned with fun than ideas anyway. This game is not like those games. It's been talked about quite a bit because not many games express ideas, and even fewer games pull that off and also happen to be fun.

During every instant of gameplay I can feel in my bone marrow the dev screaming *PLEASE MAKE IT STOP WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS PLEASE GOD NO*. It physically upsets me to play this game. The soundtrack is trying to kill you. The visuals make you want to vomit your intestines out through your nose, and it's all the more morbidly fascinating because I know how much effort it takes to make *anything* look this ugly. The character models are grotesquely designed, with misshapen forms and faces that shift and twist as you look at them from different angles. The NPCs look at you with green snake eyes or gargoyle smiles, or just completely shadowed and invisible faces with pinprick red pupils. Every person you meet is physically warped by their excessive biomodification and the overwhelming evil in their souls. The levels are designed like a fentanyl-laced LSD fever dream (in fact the game notably draws inspiration from [LSD: Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator)) and it's implied the built environment is at times comprised of humans. There are massive grinning faces stretched across the walls and the building textures in some areas resemble flesh.

I don't think I have ever seen a video game sob over the monstrous state of the world the way this game does. Not much media in general, really.

Every atom of your existence is dedicated to the acquisition of capital. You murder for it, but that's kind of mundane at this point, isn't it? You kill for money in lots of games. What makes *Cruelty Squad* stand out is that not only do you kill your enemies, you also trade their organs on the organ market, which is completely legal in the game world. Inbetween murders/organ harvestings you also daytrade on the ordinary stock markets. In fact the best way to acquire money in the game is not to complete missions but to trade stocks. After you kill the CEO of a company their stock will dip, while their competitor's share price will surge. Oh, and you can also trade fish. On the fish markets. With fish you catch yourself in the fishing mini-game. So you can shoot someone in the head, harvest his kidneys (he won't need them) consume his leftover flesh for a health bonus (cannibalism is a feature), then sell his organs on the open market. In the corporate world, this is called synergy, and in this way the player manages to gain money from every game action and input.

Oh, by the way, you'd think that consuming an entire person would provide a lot of health, right? Like, the horrific act of cannibalism would be rewarded with a large bonus, as a kind of terrible incentive, to see how far you'll go to achieve your goals?

Nope, you get one health point. One. And you do it anyway because why not? It takes an instant and those civilian corpses aren't doing anybody any good just lying there.

There are a handful of moments of kindness in the game. In one level, there's an island you can swim to, where a fisherman lives. He fishes for fun, and was made fun of for it, and is deeply annoyed that people now ask him for tips since the latest fad is trading fish on global high-speed markets. He is impressed you swam all that way and gives you his old fishing rod. From then on you can participate in the fishing mini-game and makes possibly millions of dollars off of it.

Fishing mini-games actually have a long histor-[3567 LINES REDACTED] ... but I digress.

But there's something else. Even despite the nausea-inducing everything, the game is actually pretty fun. The levels are well-designed and open-ended, the guns are satisfying to use, the sound design is visceral. So, despite the *everything* of it all, the human brain still rewards us with dopamine in exchange for violence. It is still fun to shoot videogame people in the head, and feel the recoil of the gun and listen to the sound effects.

It's also just funny at times. Here is the description for the rocket launcher: "At some point arms manufacturer Security Systems managed to convince the world that it was absolutely necessary for corporate security to possess military-grade rocket launchers."
